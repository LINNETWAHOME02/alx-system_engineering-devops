## Issue Summary
When accessing an Apache web server, users are encountering a 500 Internal Server Error. The root cause of this error needs to be identified and resolved to restore normal server functionality.

## Debugging Process
### Step 1: Using strace
Strace, a system call tracer, is utilized to inspect the Apache process and pinpoint the source of the error. By attaching strace to the running Apache process and observing its system calls, we can gather insights into what might be causing the 500 error.

### Step 2: Identifying the Issue
Through strace analysis, it was discovered that a misconfiguration in the WordPress file `wp-settings.php` was causing the error. Specifically, there was a typo in the file extension, where 'phpp' should have been 'php'.

### Step 3: Fixing the Issue
To resolve the issue, a corrective action was implemented using Puppet. Instead of manually editing the file, Puppet automation was employed to ensure consistency and reproducibility across server instances.

## Puppet Solution
The provided Puppet code snippet (`0-strace_is_your_friend.pp`) demonstrates the automated fix for the WordPress file. An `exec` resource is used to execute a `sed` command, which replaces instances of 'phpp' with 'php' in the `wp-settings.php` file located at `/var/www/html/`.

```puppet
exec { 'fix-wordpress':
  command => 'sed -i s/phpp/php/g /var/www/html/wp-settings.php',
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin/'
}
```

## Conclusion
By leveraging strace for system call analysis and Puppet for automated configuration management, the root cause of the Apache 500 error was identified and resolved efficiently. This approach ensures reliability and scalability in maintaining server configurations, minimizing downtime and enhancing overall system stability.
